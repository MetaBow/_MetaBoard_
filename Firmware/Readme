# Metaboard Firmware

Build with nRF Connect SDK 2.4.2 using the VSCode extension. The app is setup as a standalone application.
Choose the 'nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp' board target and the 'metaboard.overlay' in your build settings to build for production hardware.

Overlays for other targets provided but not recently tested. NEVER enable DCDC for metabow targets, it WILL brick the board.
