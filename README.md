### Inputs/Outputs

- RGB Status LED
- PWR/SOC LED
- 2x Programmable Buttons
- Wake, RST, and Sleep Buttons
- Magnetic USB connector
- Tag-Connect Programming power
- 10 pin IDC programming port (optional)
- 8 pin FPC connector for 5x touch inputs

### Notes:

- The board includes a 10K NTC thermistor for instances where a battery is used that does not contain an NTC. If the battery includes an NTC, the trace MUST be cut (T_CUT).
- The Power LED is unconnected. Solder the solder bridge next to QR code to enable.
- The Device can be placed into a hardware sleep mode by bridging the two SLP test pads. This is also possible by toggling P0.05

# Firmware

Build with nRF Connect SDK 2.4.2 using the VSCode extension. The app is setup as a standalone application. Choose the ```nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp``` board target and the ```metaboard.overlay``` in your build settings to build for production hardware.

Overlays for other targets have been provided but not recently tested. 

**NEVER** enable DCDC for metabow targets, it WILL brick the board.

The current firmware is designed to output 13 floating-point values via BLE: 4 values representing a quaternion and 3 values each for raw accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data. The firmware can be modified to stream additional sensor fusion values and support improved audio encoding. Firmware-level integration of the Touch IC and haptic transducer is still pending.
