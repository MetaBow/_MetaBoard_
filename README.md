### Inputs/Outputs

- RGB Status LED
- PWR LED (optional, requires solder bridge)
- 2x Buttons
- Wake Button
- Sleep trigger (only available as test pad for production use)
- Magnetic USB connector
- Tag-Connect Programming power
- 10 pin IDC programming port (optional)
- 8 pin FPC connector for 5x touch inputs

### Notes:

- The board includes a 10K NTC thermistor for instances where a battery is used that does not contain an NTC. If the battery includes an NTC, the trace MUST be cut (T_CUT).
- The Power LED is unconnected. Solder the solder bridge next to QR code to enable.
- The Device can be placed into a hardware sleep mode by bridging the two SLP test pads. This is also possible by toggling P0.05

# Firmware

Build with nRF Connect SDK 2.4.2 using the VSCode extension. The app is setup as a standalone application. Choose the ```nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp``` board target and the ```metaboard.overlay``` in your build settings to build for production hardware.

Overlays for other targets have been provided but not recently tested. 

**NEVER** enable DCDC for metabow targets, it WILL brick the board.

The current firmware is designed to output 13 floating-point values via BLE: 4 values representing a quaternion and 3 values each for raw accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data. The firmware can be modified to stream additional sensor fusion values and support improved audio encoding. Firmware-level integration of the Touch IC and haptic transducer is still pending.

A Python application that bridges Metabow Bluetooth devices with OSC (Open Sound Control), providing real-time audio processing and recording capabilities.

###  Features

- **Device Management**: connect to multiple Metabow devices simultaneously via Bluetooth LE
- **Audio Processing**: real-time audio capture and processing with configurable gain, noise gate, and noise reduction
- **OSC Integration**: route processed audio and motion data to multiple OSC destinations
- **Recording**: save processed audio as WAV files with timestamp-based naming
- **Monitoring**: real-time audio levels and latency monitoring via GUI

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies: `bleak`, `python-osc`, `numpy`, `tkinter`

### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies ```pip install bleak python-osc numpy```
   
3. Run the application ```python metabow_bridge.py```

5. In the GUI:
- **Add OSC destinations** (specify ports)
- **Scan and connect** to Metabow devices
- **Adjust audio** processing settings if needed
- **Start recording** (optional)

### Technical Notes 
 
- Optimized for MP34DT05-A PDM microphone
- Bluetooth protocol: PCM audio + motion data (13 floats) + status flag
- OSC messages: /metabow/pcm (audio) and /metabow/motion (sensor data)
