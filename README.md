### Inputs/Outputs

- RGB Status LED
- PWR LED (optional, requires solder bridge)
- 2x Buttons
- Wake Button
- Sleep trigger (only available as test pad for production use)
- Magnetic USB connector
- Tag-Connect Programming power
- 10 pin IDC programming port (optional)
- 8 pin FPC connector for 5x touch inputs

### Notes:

- The board includes a 10K NTC thermistor for instances where a battery is used that does not contain an NTC. If the battery includes an NTC, the trace MUST be cut (T_CUT).
- The Power LED is unconnected. Solder the solder bridge next to QR code to enable.
- The Device can be placed into a hardware sleep mode by bridging the two SLP test pads. This is also possible by toggling P0.05

# Firmware

Build with nRF Connect SDK 2.4.2 using the VSCode extension. The app is setup as a standalone application. Choose the ```nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp``` board target and the ```metaboard.overlay``` in your build settings to build for production hardware.

Overlays for other targets have been provided but not recently tested. 

**NEVER** enable DCDC for metabow targets, it WILL brick the board.

The current firmware is designed to output 13 floating-point values via BLE: 4 values representing a quaternion and 3 values each for raw accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data. The firmware can be modified to stream additional sensor fusion values and support improved audio encoding. Firmware-level integration of the Touch IC and haptic transducer is still pending.

A Python application that bridges Metabow Bluetooth devices with OSC (Open Sound Control), providing real-time audio processing and recording capabilities.

A Python application that bridges Metabow Bluetooth devices with OSC (Open Sound Control), providing comprehensive audio processing, recording capabilities, and motion data routing.

### 1. Features

- **Device Management**: connect to multiple Metabow devices simultaneously via Bluetooth LE
- **Audio Processing**: real-time audio capture and processing with configurable gain, noise gate, and noise reduction
- **OSC Integration**: 
  - Flexible routing system for audio and motion data
  - Support for individual routes and bundled messages
  - Customizable OSC paths and message bundling
  - Multiple OSC destinations with independent routing configurations
- **Recording**: WAV file recording with timestamp-based naming
- **Monitoring**: 
  - Real-time audio levels (peak and noise floor)
  - Latency monitoring (average, peak, and buffer)
  - Comprehensive logging system
  - Route discovery and monitoring
- **Virtual Audio Output**: integration with VB-Cable for virtual audio device routing (Note: This feature is currently in development and not fully functional)

### 2. Requirements

#### 2.1 Core Dependencies
- `Python 3.x`
- `bleak`
- `python-osc`
- `numpy`
- `tkinter`
- `pyaudio`
- `sounddevice`

#### 2.2 Optional Dependencies
- VB-Cable (for virtual audio routing - feature in development)

### 3. Quick Start

1. Install dependencies `pip install bleak python-osc numpy pyaudio sounddevice`
   
3. Run the application ```python metabow_bridge.py```

5. In the GUI:
   - **Add OSC destinations** (specify ports)
   - **Scan and connect** to Metabow devices
   - **Configure routing:**
     - Add individual routes for specific data
     - Create bundles for combined messages
     - Customize OSC paths as needed
   - **Adjust audio** processing settings if needed
